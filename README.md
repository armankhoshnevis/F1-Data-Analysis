# Foundation of Data Science (CMSE 830 - MSU) - MidTerm Project: F1 Data Analysis

In this project, we are primarily focused on the data analysis of the "Hybrid Era" of Formula 1, which began in 2014 with the introduction of 1.6-liter V6 turbocharged hybrid power units. Emphasis is placed on data from 2017 onwards, to account for the learning curve teams faced while adapting to hybrid engines and to observe the impact of the regulation changes in 2022, along with the dominance and team battles in recent years.
